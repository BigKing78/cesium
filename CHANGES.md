# Change Log

### v0.2.0

##### Breaking Changes :mega:

- Renamed `CesiumTransforms` to `CesiumWgs84Ellipsoid`.

##### Additions :tada:

- Added support for building to iOS.
- Added `CesiumCameraController`, a globe-aware controller that adapts its speed and clipping planes based on its height from the globe.
- Added `CesiumFlyToController`, a controller that can smoothly fly to locations across the globe.
- Added an option to add a `DynamicCamera` from the Cesium panel to the scene. The `DynamicCamera` contains `CesiumCameraController` and `CesiumFlyToController` components and offers easy navigation of the globe.

##### Fixes :wrench:

- `CesiumRuntimeSettings` is now stored in `Assets/CesiumSettings/Resources` instead of `Assets/Settings/Resources`.

### v0.1.1

The atomic element Cesium typically forms bonds with other elements by being oxidized, or losing an electron. The Oxidize tool generates a "bindings" layer that helps Cesium Native bond with code written in C#.

The most important piece of Oxidize is a Roslyn Incremental Generator. The Oxidize assembly is added to a target project as a Roslyn Analyzer, causing it to be invoked when the target project is compiled.
